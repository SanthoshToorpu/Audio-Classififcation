Certainly! Here's a simple template for a `README.md` file for your GitHub project on Audio Classification using the ESC-50 dataset:

```markdown
# Audio Classification with ESC-50 Dataset

## 1. Dataset

The project utilizes the ESC-50 dataset, a collection of 2000 environmental audio recordings equally distributed across 50 classes. Each class represents a different sound event, making it suitable for audio classification tasks. You can find the dataset [here](link_to_dataset).

## 2. Source

The source code for this project can be found in the [src](src) directory.

## 3. Technologies Used

- Python
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- TensorFlow (or any other machine learning framework of your choice)
- Matplotlib (for plotting results)

Make sure to install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Final Result

The model achieved impressive results in audio classification, with accuracy reaching [accuracy_percentage]% on the validation set. For a detailed overview of the training process and performance metrics, refer to the [notebooks](notebooks) directory.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the audio classification script:

   ```bash
   python src/audio_classification.py
   ```

   This script will load the trained model and perform audio classification on a sample audio file.

Feel free to customize this template based on the specifics of your project. Include more details, such as model architecture, training process, and any additional features you'd like to highlight.
```

Make sure to replace placeholders like `[link_to_dataset]`, `[accuracy_percentage]`, `your-username`, and `your-repo` with the actual values and details relevant to your project.
